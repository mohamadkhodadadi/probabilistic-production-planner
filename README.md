# 🎯 Probabilistic Production Planner

A dynamic programming-based web tool to determine the most cost-effective production schedule under uncertainty.

## 🧠 What It Does

This app helps you decide:
- **How many units to produce per day** given a limited number of days.
- **Cost-effective launch strategies** when quality control is probabilistic.
- Whether it's more economical to build in bulk or spread production across multiple days.

It considers:
- ✅ Order value
- ⏳ Available production days
- 📦 Order size
- 💸 Unit production cost
- 🚀 Cost per production launch
- 📊 Probability of passing quality control
- 🔒 Option to enforce "all-or-nothing" production

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5 + CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries!)
- Dynamic Programming
- Binomial Distribution (Probabilistic Modeling)
